# Team Management System Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive team management system for the multi-tenant SaaS platform with role-based access control (RBAC). This system allows tenant administrators to manage their team members, invite new users, and control access permissions.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Backend Implementation (Go)

#### Models (`/models/team.go`)

- **Enhanced User Profile**: Extended with role, permissions, and tenant context
- **Team Member Management**: Complete team member lifecycle management
- **Invitation System**: Secure token-based invitation workflow
- **Role Hierarchy**: 5-tier role system (user ‚Üí tenant_analyst ‚Üí tenant_marketer ‚Üí tenant_admin ‚Üí superadmin)

#### Services (`/services/team_service.go`)

- **Team Management**: CRUD operations for team members
- **Invitation Workflow**: Send, accept, decline, and track invitations
- **Permission Validation**: Granular permission checking system
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling

#### API Handlers (`/handlers/team_handler.go`)

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Complete REST API for team management
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth with role checking

- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and logging

### 2. Frontend Implementation (React/TypeScript)

#### Type System (`/types/team.ts`)

- **Role Definitions**: TypeScript types for all roles and permissions
- **Permission System**: 25+ granular permissions across functional domains
